## What's the project?

The project is a test to solve some problems of github-markdown-css in reblog-theme-macaron.

## How to use the project?

If you don't want to use my products, you can build css files of the project on your local pc.

## How to build the css project?

Clone the project using this command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FloatSheep/macaron-github-markdown-css.git
```

Execute the build command:

```bash
npm run build
```

If you use pnpm and other package managers, you can use `<name of the package manager> (run) build` to build.

And if you’re using pnpm or any other package manager, you can adapt the command accordingly. Just remember that sometimes the (run) part is optional in certain package managers. If you’re unsure, stick to the traditional command—it won’t steer you wrong!
